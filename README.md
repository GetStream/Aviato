# Aviato by GetStream.io

Built by GetStream.io as an example app, Aviato allows users to view the latest tweets mentioning the [@FlyFrontier](https://twitter.com/@FlyFrontier) Twitter handle. The frontend is built with Stream's React Native Components for Building Activity Feeds (http://bit.ly/2RgGxLa) and the backend is entirely serverless using Stream, AWS API Gateway, Lambda and S3 via the https://serverless.com platform. The Aviato project is entirely open-source and available at http://bit.ly/2Rhdlnl.
